# Cobb County School District (CCSD)
## COVID-19 Data

CCSD [provides](https://www.cobbk12.org/page/40801/covid-case-notification) current school year COVID-19 cases statistics by school, with active and cumulative numbers. Additionally a cumulative value is provided, however this does not match the summation of cumulative numbers in the data matrix, so there 
is some margin of error here. Previous pages can be retrieved via [WaybackMachine](https://web.archive.org/web/20210522002900/https://www.cobbk12.org/page/40801/covid-case-notification)
